# Contract requests

**Append-only.** Requests from one track to another for something the requester cannot change
themselves: a shared contract shape (`packages/core`), a backend surface (API, migrations), or a
fact only the owner can check. Never edit or delete an entry. To change its status, append a new
dated line under it.

Each entry: **date · requester · owner asked · shape or answer needed · why · status.**

### CR-1 — Is `BACKUP_DESTINATION` set?

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Date | 2026-09-28 |
| Requester | Frontend (FE-D1 session) |
| Owner asked | Backend (BE-W11) |
| Needed | A yes or no: does the repository secret `BACKUP_DESTINATION` exist? |
| Status | **Open** |

**Why.** `.github/workflows/backup.yml:85` sets `DEFERRAL_EXPIRES: '2026-10-15'`. The job fails when
`TODAY > DEFERRAL_EXPIRES` (`:107`), **but only if that secret is unset** (`:100-104`). Repository
secrets can't be seen from the tree, so the first red date is **conditional**: from 2026-10-16 UTC
on any run, and first on the weekly schedule on Monday 2026-10-19, *if* the secret is missing. If
it is set, the job doesn't go red on a date at all. Frontend reported it as conditional and needs
the owner's answer before calling it either way.

### CR-2 — Stale "30 September" deadline in a document frontend does not own

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Date | 2026-09-28 |
| Requester | Frontend (FE-D1 session) |
| Owner asked | Owner of `handoff-frontend.md` |
| Needed | Correct or annotate `handoff-frontend.md:259`, which still says "contract I3 (CI deadline **30 September 2026**)" |
| Status | **Open** |

**Why.** That deadline was retired on 22 September (MR-50 B3). `transcript-v0.expiry.test.ts` no
longer checks a date. Anyone following the handoff will chase a deadline that can't fire.
Frontend was told not to edit the file. The same correction for the documents frontend *does*
append to is in `PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md` → FE-D1.

---

*FE-D1 itself needed no new contract shape. The check-in queue row uses `SyncQueueItem` and
`CreateCheckInRequest` exactly as `packages/core` already defines them.*

### CR-3 — Can an MR call the five functions that would replace the mock, and do they return the contract shapes?

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Date | 2026-09-28 |
| Requester | Frontend (screen inventory, `docs/screen-inventory-2026-09-28.md` §d) |
| Owner asked | Backend |
| Needed | For each of `daily_mileage`, `list_analyses`, `read_analysis`, `respond_to_analysis`, `list_consent_records`: (1) is it granted to, and does it behave for, an **MR's** session? (2) does its return parse against the `packages/core` schema the screen already uses (`MileageRowSchema` or `MileageDaySchema`, `AnalysisSchema`, `ConsentRecordSchema`, in `packages/core/src/field/`)? A yes or no per function, plus the name of any mismatch. |
| Status | **Open** |

**Why.** Six MR screens read through the mock server (`apps/field/src/config.ts:42` defaults to
`http://127.0.0.1:4010`): report labels, day-end, mileage, coaching, analysis and reply. A real device
can't reach that address. Each operation already has a real function in migrations
(`20260815000100_thresholds_and_shift_defaults.sql` for `daily_mileage`;
`20260811000300_audit_log.sql` for the other four), so frontend is **not asking for a new endpoint**.
The frontend can't tell from the tree whether those functions were written for an MR caller or a
manager caller, or whether their output matches what the screens parse. If the answer is yes, the
switch is frontend-only. If it's no, what's needed is exactly what this entry asks for.

### CR-4 — Should an approximate location fix be treated differently at check-in?

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Date | 2026-09-28 |
| Requester | Frontend (FE-D3 A2; raised at the operator's ruling in FE-D4) |
| Owner asked | Backend |
| Needed | A decision, and then whatever shape it implies |
| Status | **Open** — a question, not a demand |

**The question.** The check-in stores the fix's accuracy, but the geofence verdict ignores it, so an
approximate fix is judged on its centre point, and nothing marks a check-in as approximate. Should
the verdict take accuracy into account, or should check-ins be flagged when the fix was
approximate?

**What frontend found, so the answer can be checked rather than trusted:**

- **The client sends accuracy.** `takeFix` sets `coordinates.accuracyMetres` from the fix
  (`apps/field/src/capture/location.ts:83`). It is a radius in metres. Nothing on the phone records
  "approximate" as such.
- **The server stores it.** `record_check_in` and `record_check_out` write it to
  `check_ins.accuracy_metres` and `check_outs.accuracy_metres`
  (`20260811000100_commercial_schema.sql:322, 339`; latest `record_check_in` in
  `20260911000300_check_in_starts_the_visit.sql:20, 76-81`).
- **The verdict does not read it.** `v_geofence` is decided by
  `v_distance <= coalesce(v_clinic.geofence_radius_metres, 150)` alone
  (`20260911000300_check_in_starts_the_visit.sql:70-74`).
- **Why it matters now.** Since FE-D2 10, first run treats an approximate-only grant (Android 12+)
  as granted, by operator ruling. A rep who chose approximate sends fixes that can be a few
  kilometres wide against a 150 m geofence, and the verdict cannot tell that apart from a precise
  fix.

Frontend changes nothing until this is answered.
