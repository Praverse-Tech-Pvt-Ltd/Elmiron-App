-- Rollback for MR-27 B1 -- the transmitted consent-notice precedence.
--
-- Three things, in dependency order: `sync_pull` stops joining the view, `active_consent_text_at`
-- goes back to ordering by its own keys, and only then can the view be dropped.
--
-- THIS PUTS THE ORDERING RULE BACK IN TWO PLACES. With no `precedence` on the wire the client
-- has to choose among the notices itself, which means reproducing
-- `effective_from desc, created_at desc, id desc` on the device. A disagreement between the
-- two copies does not fail in a test -- it fails as a `45001` refusal, at capture, with a
-- doctor waiting. That is the state MR-27 B1 removed and it is what applying this restores.
--
-- The client half is not undone by this file. Rolling this back without also reverting
-- `activeNoticeFor` leaves a client reading a `precedence` the server no longer sends, and
-- `PulledConsentTextVersionSchema` will refuse every notice row -- the screen shows "there is
-- no consent notice for this language yet" rather than silently choosing wrong. That is the
-- better of the two failures and it is deliberate, but it means this rollback is a SCHEMA
-- rollback and the app must be rolled back with it.
