# MR App — Project Overview

Pharmaceutical field-force app for medical representatives in India. MR app only —
the patient app is a separate project with a separate database.

**This file is append-only.** Every later prompt adds a new `###` section under
"Phase log". Nothing already written here gets overwritten.

---

## Current state

Week 1 of 12. Backend foundations only. There are no product features and no
product APIs yet.

What exists and runs:

- A Turborepo + pnpm monorepo with five workspaces, strict TypeScript, ESLint and
  Prettier.
- GitHub Actions CI with two jobs, both failing the build rather than warning.
- A local Supabase stack with one migration applied: role enum, territories,
  user profiles, a JWT claims hook and two helper functions.
- `packages/core` — contract **I1** — published with types, Zod schemas and a typed
  API client covering every entity and endpoint the app will have.
- 30 passing tests: 12 contract guards in `packages/core`, 18 database tests in
  `services/api`.

What does not exist yet: the commercial schema, the full RLS policy set, the audit
log, the consent ledger tables, the mock server, and every API endpoint. All BE-W2.

---

## Architecture decisions

**Contract-first, schema-derived types.** `packages/core` defines Zod schemas and
derives the TypeScript types from them with `z.infer`. One source of truth.
_Rules out:_ hand-written interfaces drifting from runtime validation, and any
"the types say X but the server sends Y" class of bug.

**API is camelCase; Postgres is snake_case.** Mapping happens at the API edge.
_Rules out:_ snake_case leaking into React components, and the alternative of
naming Postgres columns in camelCase, which needs quoting everywhere.

**Role lives in the JWT, put there by a custom access token hook.**
`public.custom_access_token_hook` reads `user_profiles` at token-issue time and adds
`app_role`, `app_territory_id` and `app_is_active` claims.
_Rules out:_ a `user_profiles` lookup on every policy evaluation.
_Cost, and it is a real one:_ a role or territory change only takes effect on the
next token refresh (1 hour by default). Deactivation therefore cannot rely on the
claim alone — `visible_territory_ids` re-reads `is_active` from the table for
exactly this reason.

**`visible_territory_ids(uuid)` is SECURITY DEFINER and not granted to
`authenticated`.** It takes an arbitrary user id, so granting it would let any MR
enumerate a colleague's scope. Client-reachable code uses the no-argument wrapper
`current_user_visible_territory_ids()`.
_Rules out:_ scope enumeration through a helper that looks harmless.

**RLS is on from the first table, not retrofitted.** Both tables have RLS enabled
and neither has an INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE policy, so `authenticated` cannot write
to either. Provisioning runs through `service_role` until the admin APIs land in
week 11.

**`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` is deliberately not used on these two tables.** The
SECURITY DEFINER helpers run as the table owner; FORCE would subject them to the
same policies and they would return nothing. The append-only tables in BE-W2
(`audit_log`, `consent_records`) have the opposite requirement and are handled
separately there.

**Table privileges are revoked before they are granted.** Supabase's default
privileges hand `authenticated` and `anon` a **TRUNCATE** grant on new public
tables, and TRUNCATE ignores row-level security entirely. This was found by a test,
not by reading documentation. Every table from here on gets an explicit
`revoke all ... from anon, authenticated` before its grants.
_Rules out:_ an RLS policy set that looks airtight and is bypassable with one
statement.

**Email is not duplicated into `user_profiles`.** It lives on `auth.users` and is
read from the session. _Rules out:_ two copies to keep in sync.

**`declined` is a schema-level equal.** `ConsentOutcome` has exactly three values,
all three are valid completions of a visit, and there is no penalty, flag or score
field anywhere near a consent record. A test asserts the absence of those fields by
name.

**No composite score anywhere in `Analysis`.** A test asserts `score`, `rating`,
`rank`, `percentile` and `grade` are absent. `Finding.citations` is `.min(1)` —
an uncited finding fails validation rather than rendering.

**Rollback SQL lives in `services/api/rollbacks/`, not inside `supabase/migrations/`.**
The CLI has no down-migration step; keeping the files next to the migrations risks
the CLI applying them. They are applied by hand with psql.

## Phase log

### BE-W1 — Foundations (10 August 2026)

#### What was built

**1. Monorepo**

Turborepo 2.10 + pnpm 11 workspaces, Node 24 pinned in `.nvmrc` and `engines`.
Strict TypeScript throughout — `strict`, plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`,
`exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, `verbatimModuleSyntax`, `isolatedModules`,
`noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature`. ESLint 9 flat config on
`typescript-eslint` **strictTypeChecked** with `eslint-config-prettier`.
Prettier for formatting; `docs/` is prettier-ignored so the reviewer's planning
documents are never reformatted.

The five workspaces resolve, build and typecheck. `apps/field` and `apps/console`
each import from `@elmiron/core`, which proves the contract package resolves from a
consumer before Frontend touches it.

**2. CI** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, two jobs, on every PR and every push to main:

- `static` — install, build, typecheck, lint, `prettier --check`, `packages/core`
  unit tests.
- `database` — brings up the local Supabase stack, which applies every migration to
  an empty database in order, then runs the `services/api` database tests. From
  BE-W2 this job also runs the adversarial RLS suite that proves Gate 0.

Both fail the build. Neither warns.

**3. Supabase**

The existing local stack moved from the repo root to `services/api/supabase`. Root
scripts run the CLI with `--workdir services/api`. The CLI is a dev dependency, not
a global install.

`config.toml` registers the custom access token hook. Auth is email + password and
email OTP (`otp_length = 6`, `otp_expiry = 3600`).

`.env.example` documents every variable including `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` and
`SUPABASE_REGION=ap-south-1`. No project reference is hardcoded anywhere in the
repo. No secrets are committed.

**4. Auth, roles and the two helpers**

Migration `20260810000100_roles_territories_profiles.sql`:

| Object                                        | Notes                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `public.app_role`                             | enum: `mr`, `field_manager`, `admin`                                                                         |
| `public.territories`                          | self-referencing hierarchy, `on delete restrict`, unique `code`                                              |
| `public.user_profiles`                        | one auth user → one role, one territory, one reporting manager, one active flag                              |
| `public.set_updated_at()`                     | trigger helper on both tables                                                                                |
| `public.custom_access_token_hook(jsonb)`      | adds `app_role`, `app_territory_id`, `app_is_active` to the JWT                                              |
| `public.current_app_role()`                   | **helper 1** — the caller's role, read from the JWT claim                                                    |
| `public.visible_territory_ids(uuid)`          | **helper 2** — MR: own territory. Manager: own subtree, recursive. Admin: all. Inactive or unknown: nothing. |
| `public.current_user_visible_territory_ids()` | grantable wrapper for the above                                                                              |

Two check constraints worth knowing about: an `mr` or `field_manager` cannot exist
without a territory (a scopeless user would silently see nothing and read as a bug),
and nobody can be their own reporting manager or their own parent territory.

RLS policies created:

| Policy                            | Table           | Effect                                                |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `user_profiles_select_self`       | `user_profiles` | a user reads their own row                            |
| `user_profiles_select_auth_admin` | `user_profiles` | the auth server reads profiles to mint the role claim |
| `territories_select_visible`      | `territories`   | reads restricted to the caller's visible set          |

No write policy on either table. `revoke all ... from anon, authenticated` precedes
every grant.

**5. `packages/core` — contract I1**

Published. Every entity the brief listed, plus the ones that are structurally
required by them:

`Role` · `UserProfile` · `Territory` · `Doctor` · `ClinicAddress` · `BeatPlan` ·
`BeatPlanEntry` · `Visit` · `CheckIn` · `CheckOut` · `CallReport` ·
`SampleAndInput` · `ConsentOutcome` · `ConsentTextVersion` · `ConsentRecord` ·
`VoiceNote` · `Recording` · `Transcript` · `TranscriptSegment` · `Finding` ·
`FindingCitation` · `Analysis` · `AnalysisOverride` · `SyncQueueItem`

Plus primitives (`Uuid`, `IsoDateTime`, `IsoDate`, `LanguageTag`, `Coordinates`),
the error envelope (`ApiErrorCode` including `permission_denied`, `ApiError`,
`ApiRequestError`), cursor pagination, and request/response shapes for every
endpoint through week 11 — doctors, beat plans, visits, check-in/out, call reports,
approvals, samples and inputs, consent capture and withdrawal, resumable upload
sessions, transcripts, analyses, MR responses, manager overrides, and sync
push/pull. `API_PATHS` holds the paths so the week-2 mock server and the client
cannot drift.

A typed `createApiClient` parses every response against its schema and throws
`ApiRequestError` on any non-2xx, carrying the code through so a denial surfaces as
a denial.

#### Types published in packages/core

See the list under item 5 above. All exported from `@elmiron/core`.

**Message for Frontend and AI/ML:**

- Import from `@elmiron/core`. Do not redeclare these shapes locally.
- `Transcript`, `TranscriptSegment`, `Finding` and `FindingCitation` are
  **provisional compile targets**. The authoritative versions are AI/ML's contracts
  I3 (end week 2), I4 (end week 6) and I5 (end week 8). Both files say so in a
  header comment. Replace them; do not extend them silently.
- Backend will not change this package without announcing it in writing first.

#### Open questions for the reviewer

**1. "Permission denied, not an empty result" cannot be delivered by RLS alone. This
one needs a decision before BE-W2 starts.**

A Postgres `SELECT` under an RLS `USING` clause returns **zero rows**, not an error.
That is how RLS works. So the Gate 0 assertion — _"assert every one of those attempts
returns permission denied, not an empty result set"_ — is not satisfiable by RLS
policies on their own, on any of the five attack paths in the brief.

What is verifiable today, end to end (evidence below): a **write** as an MR returns
`403 permission denied`, not a silent no-op. A **read** outside scope returns `200 []`.

Three ways to close the read gap, and they differ a lot in cost:

- **(a)** Route every read through a `SECURITY DEFINER` function that checks scope
  and `raise exception`s with SQLSTATE `42501`. Genuine denials on every path,
  including raw SQL. Costs: no PostgREST auto-generated endpoints — every read is a
  hand-written RPC.
- **(b)** Keep RLS for the row filter, but make single-resource reads
  (`GET /visits/:id`) resolve through an edge function that distinguishes
  "does not exist" from "not yours" and returns 403. List endpoints still return
  `[]`. Cheaper, and it fails the brief's raw-SQL path.
- **(c)** Accept the empty result for reads, on the argument that the filter is in
  Postgres rather than application code — which is the actual risk §2.1 is about —
  and reserve hard denials for writes.

I have built nothing that presumes an answer. **My recommendation is (a) for
`analyses` and `consent_records`, and (c) elsewhere.** Those two tables are the
sensitive ones — an MR's analysis is employment data and consent is the legal basis
for the recording feature — and (a) is expensive enough that applying it to
`doctors` and `beat_plans` would slow the whole project for little gain. Tell me if
you want (a) everywhere; it changes the shape of most of BE-W2.

**2. Supabase project region is unverified from here.** `.mcp.json` points at project
ref `pgfdbzoapmleqtoezhoa`. The Supabase MCP returned "You do not have permission to
perform this action" for `get_project`, so I could not confirm the region
programmatically. **Please confirm in the dashboard that it is `ap-south-1`
(Mumbai).** The region cannot be changed later without a full migration, and
everything after week 1 assumes it.

**3. The role claim is stale for up to an hour after a change.** JWT expiry is 3600s.
Deactivating a user does not take effect in their claims until refresh.
`visible_territory_ids` re-reads `is_active` from the table so scope collapses
immediately, but any future policy written against `app_is_active` from the JWT
would not. Options: shorten `jwt_expiry`, or make every policy read `user_profiles`
rather than the claim. I would rather settle this before BE-W2 writes twenty
policies against one or the other.

**4. Raising it as instructed — the PV and privacy sign-off on the adverse-event
position.** It blocks week 7 and it needs two named people, not two teams.
`mr-app-plan.md` §0.4 sets out the contradiction: IPC §2.6 requires an identifiable
patient to file a valid case report, DPDP minimisation requires that you not retain
one. This is week 1; chasing it in week 6 is too late.

**5. Prompt BE-W1 said the planning documents move to `/docs`.** They were in `Docs/`
and are now in `docs/` via a two-step `git mv`. Windows is case-insensitive, so if
anyone's checkout looks odd after pulling, that rename is why.

## How to run

Prerequisites: Node 24, pnpm 11, Docker running. Setup steps are in
`docs/backend-setup.md`.

```bash
pnpm install

# Local Supabase stack (Docker must be running)
pnpm db:start          # prints API URL, keys, Studio URL
pnpm db:status
pnpm db:reset          # drops and re-applies every migration from scratch
pnpm db:stop

# The full CI gate, locally
pnpm run build
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm run format:check
pnpm --filter @elmiron/core test    # contract guards, no database needed
pnpm --filter @elmiron/api test     # database tests, needs the stack running
```

`services/api` tests skip rather than fail when no database is reachable, so
`pnpm test` is useful without Docker. CI sets `SUPABASE_DB_URL` explicitly, so CI
never skips.

Studio: `http://127.0.0.1:54323`. Mail catcher: `http://127.0.0.1:54324`.

### Verification evidence — BE-W1, 10 August 2026

```
$ pnpm run typecheck
 Tasks:    7 successful, 7 total

$ pnpm run lint
 Tasks:    5 successful, 5 total

$ pnpm run format:check
All matched files use Prettier code style!

$ pnpm --filter @elmiron/core test
 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  12 passed (12)

$ pnpm db:reset
Applying migration 20260810000100_roles_territories_profiles.sql...
Finished supabase db reset on branch main.

$ pnpm --filter @elmiron/api test
 Test Files  1 passed (1)
      Tests  18 passed (18)
```

End-to-end check of the JWT hook and RLS, run against the local stack with a real
signed-in MR (throwaway script, not committed):

```
created auth user: 6d8a3034-8610-415c-a979-bc5fdafb289a
JWT claims of interest: {
  app_role: 'mr',
  app_territory_id: '90000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001',
  app_is_active: true
}
GET  /territories   -> 200 [{"id":"90000000-...-000000000001","code":"HOOK-CHECK"}]
GET  /user_profiles -> 200 [{"id":"6d8a3034-...","role":"mr"}]
POST /territories   -> 403 {"code":"42501","message":"permission denied for table territories"}
```

The hook fires, the claims land in the token, the MR reads only what they should,
and a write attempt is denied rather than silently dropped.

## Known gaps

1. **Reads outside scope return an empty list, not a denial.** Open question 1
   above. This is the single most important thing to settle before BE-W2.
2. **The Supabase project region is unconfirmed** from this machine. Open question 2.
3. **The custom access token hook is configured for local only.** `config.toml`
   registers it; the linked remote project needs the hook enabled in
   Dashboard → Authentication → Hooks after the first `db push`. Not done — the
   remote project is not linked yet.
4. **No `services/api/supabase/seed.sql`.** `db reset` warns about it. Seeding
   arrives with the BE-W2 test fixtures.
5. **Rollback SQL is not exercised by CI.** The down file exists and is checked in;
   nothing proves it runs. Worth a CI step in BE-W2.
6. **No user provisioning path.** Users are created through `service_role` or Studio
   until the admin APIs land in week 11.
7. **`apps/field` and `apps/console` are empty placeholders.** They typecheck; they
   are not applications.
8. **`packages/ui-tokens` exports empty objects.** Frontend populates it.
9. **The MCP Supabase server is unauthenticated in this session**, so nothing here
   was verified against the hosted project — only against the local stack.
